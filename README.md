# IOT Project Bulletstorm

## Project Description

The target of the project is to develop a game of the **top-down-shooter** genre that is controlled 
using a physical weapon. It aims to resemble an arcade-style shooter.

The basic game-loop of the game results in the player aiming at the screen using a real weapon. 
The player will have to fend off an unstoppable onslaught of enemies as well as dodging all their 
attacks. There will be a wide range of possible virtual weapons as well as abilities or powerups like 
healing and damage increases to help out the player survive.

The **physical weapon** will have a **gyroscope and compass** attached to detect any movement of the 
weapon as well as several buttons to control in-game actions such as firing. In addition to those 
features the weapon will have included a rumble motor as well as leds to grant more physical 
feedback to the user
